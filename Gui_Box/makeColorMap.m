function [ cmap ] = makeColorMap( varargin )
%MAKECOLORMAP Summary of this function goes here
%This function is used to produce linearly interpolated colormaps that go
%through more than one color.  For example, go from red to black to green
%with black in the middle.  Used in making simulated red-grey-green
%velocity fields.
%
%You may call the function with 1 of four syntaxes
%-2 input color vectors (3 element RGB color vectors)
% --this will produce a single transition from color1 to color2 with the
% default number of colors (32)
%-3 input color vectors
% --produce a 3 color cmap from color1 to color2 to color3 with the default
% number of colors (32)
%-2 input colors followed by a single number
% --produce a 2 color cmap from color1 to color2 with argin3 number of
% colors
%-3 input colors followed by a single number
% --produce a 3 color cmap from color1 to color2 to color3 with argin4
% number of colors
%
%NOTE: The order matters... the "bottom" color of the colormap should be
%the first color introduce and the "top" color the last number.  And if a
%specific number of colors is desired it should always be the last input.
%
%This is a general use function created by Andrew Hall on or around May
%2011
